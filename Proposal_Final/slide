Introduction:
Obesity is a major health concern affecting over 890 million adults globally, increasing risks for conditions like diabetes, heart disease, and certain cancers.

Similarly, being underweight can lead to weakened immunity, developmental issues, and higher susceptibility to infections

These are often caused by a combination of genetic, physiological, and lifestyle factors.

These combined issues highlight the need for solutions that support healthy weight management.



Underweight:
Used CatBoost to predict obesity in overweight adults.
Used Body measurements and demographics for prediction
Accuracy is 87%

Limitation:
Did not consider individual's with underweight
Did not consider lifestyle factors


Only Logistic regression:
Developed a logistic regression model to predict obesity in 10-year-olds.
Incorporated physical activity, eating habits, and maternal characteristics.
Used LASSO for feature selection.
Model accuracy: 76%
limitations:
Only logistic regression was used
Low accuracy
No recommendations

NO multi level:
Used XGBoost for obesity classification in young Chileans.
Used biochemical data for classification.
Achieved AUC of 0.818.

Limitations:
 Ignored lifestyle factors.
 Did not considered detailed obesity levels.
 
 
 No lifestyle factor recommendation:
 diet recommendations, focusing on fluid, carbohydrate, protein, and fat intake
 
 
 [4]
Analyzed metabolic factors affecting BMI and obesity
 Accuracy:72% for males,76% for females .
 Limitations:
 ignored lifestyle factors
 low accuracy
 
 
 
 
 Objectives:
 • To identify key factors associated with both underweight and obesity, and prepare
a dataset.
• To develop a classification system that classifies weight into 5 categories using
current physical conditions and lifestyle factors.
• To select the best performing machine learning model for predicting weight cat-
egory by fine-tuning hyperparameters to achieve better accuracy.
• To use Explainable AI for highlighting the main features contributing to the pre-
diction of weight category and provide personalized recommendations for users
to improve their health outcomes.
• To develop a mobile app that predicts weight category, highlights key factors
influencing the prediction, and offers personalized health recommendations.





methodology:
The main objective of my work is to develop a machine learning model that predicts obesity risk by identifying key physical and lifestyle factors. It will also provide personalized recommendations to improve health outcomes.

The system consists of two sections which are described below



Conclusion:
A dataset will be developed to include essential physical and lifestyle factors for accurate obesity risk prediction.
A machine learning model will be developed to classify weight categories effectively.
Explainable AI techniques will be implemented to provide personalized recommendations based on individual predictions.



Motivation:
Obesity and underweight are serious health issues affecting millions of people.
There is a need for solutions to identify those at risk and provide personalized advice.
This study uses machine learning to analyze lifestyle and health factors, helping users make better choices.
By focusing on both overweight and underweight conditions, we aim for a complete approach to health management.



Application:
Personalized Healthcare: Assesses obesity risk using lifestyle factors for tailored healthcare advice.
Public Health Campaigns: Identifies at-risk populations to guide obesity prevention initiatives.
Telemedicine Integration: Offers real-time obesity risk assessments to improve remote healthcare services.
